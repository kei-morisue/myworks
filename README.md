generate crease patterns (and photos) gallery from the files uploaded on the server. 

1. uploaded files (input)
    - uses directories partitioned by models as the input
    - each directories has 
        - cp source(.cp / .opx /.ori) 
        - the photos of the model
        - the name of the model as the name of the directory
1. rendering cp
    - automatically rendered from source cp files
    - single cp for a model for now
